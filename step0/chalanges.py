# The program takes a temperature in Celsius as input from the user, converts it to Fahrenheit, and prints the result.
# The conversion formula used is F = (9/5) * C + 32, where F is the temperature in Fahrenheit and C is the temperature in Celsius.
# The program uses the input() function to get user input and converts the input string to a float using the float() function.
# The result is then printed to the console.
