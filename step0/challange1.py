# The program takes a temperature in Fahrenheit as input from the user, converts it to Celsius, and prints the result.
# The conversion formula used is C = (5/9) * (F - 32), where C is the temperature in Celsius and F is the temperature in Fahrenheit.
# The program uses the input() function to get user input and converts20 the input string to a float using the float() function.
# The result is then printed to the console.
