# This is a simple calculator program that takes two numbers as input
# and performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on them.
# It then prints the results of each operation.
# The program uses the input() function to get user input and converts
# the input strings to integers using the int() function.
# The results of the operations are stored in variables and printed to the console.
# The program is written in Python and uses basic arithmetic operations.
# The program is designed to be simple and easy to understand for beginners.
# It demonstrates the use of variables, input, output, and basic arithmetic operations in Python.

# Simple calculator program
# This program takes two numbers as input and performs basic arithmetic operations
a=input("enter the number:");
b=input("enter the number:");

# Perform arithmetic operations
Addition=int(a)+int(b);
Subtraction=int(a)-int(b);
Division=int(a)/int(b);
Multipluction=int(a)*int(b);
# Print the results of the operations
print("Addition:",Addition);
print("subtration:",Subtraction);
print("division:",Division);
print("Multiplication:",Multipluction);
