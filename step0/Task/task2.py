#For printing the concatenated name we have two methods
# 1. Using the store a and b in c variable then print the c variable
# 2. second method is to directly print the concatenated name without using a third variable
# This program takes two strings as input from the user, concatenates them,

a=input("Enter Your First Name: ")
b=input(" Enter Your Last Name:  ")
# Concatenate the first and last names
c=a+b
# Print the concatenated name
# print("Hello ",c,"Welcome to Python Programming")
print("Hello ",a+b,"Welcome to Python Programming")
# The program takes two strings as input from the user, concatenates them, and prints the result.
